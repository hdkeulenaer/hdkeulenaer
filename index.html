  <p>0005 - "Our gross national product ... counts air pollution and cigarette advertising, and ambulances to clear our highways of carnage.

It counts napal and the cost of a nuclear warhead, and armoured cars for police who fight riots in our streets ... Yet the gross national product does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education or the joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials ... it measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile." ~ Robert Kennedy (1968)</p>

  <p>0034 - Usus efficacissimus rerum omnium magister. ~ Pliny<br>Practice is the best teacher of all things.</p>
    <p class="comment">--- Montaigne's comment: "For, in truth, custom is a violent and treacherous schoolmistress. She, by little and little, slily and unperceived, slips in the foot of her authority, but having by this gentle and humble beginning, with the benefit of time, fixed and established it, she then unmasks a furious and tyrannic countenance, against which we have no more the courage or the power so much as to lift up our eyes."<br>Or the power of habit.</p>
  <p>0035 - The methods of segmenting a market are endless. ~ Nicola Scirocco</p>

  <p>0038 - ... und alles, was man weiss, nicht bloss rauschen und brausen gehört hat, lässt sich in drei Worten sagen. ~ Kürnberger (1877)</p>
    <p class="comment">--- The motto chosen by Wittgenstein for the Tractatus. Don't ask :-). The full sentence: "So haben ganze Welten von Vorstellungen, wenn man sie wirklich beherrscht, in einer Nuß Platz, und Alles, was man weiß, nicht blos rauschen und brausen gehört hat, läßt sich in drei Worten sagen." When we understand, we don't need many words. </p>
  <p>0039 - I am convinced that the works on view in the museums and those we consider to be exceptional, do not represent the finest achievements in the world. ~ Marcel Duchamp</p>
    <p class="comment">--- There is politics in curation. For that matter, those who have their name assigned to an invention of a scientific law were rarely the first ones and certainly not the only ones with that idea. For any person of merit, it is probably a chore to accept an award.</p>
  <p id="0040">0040 - Emotions are judgments. ~ Chrusippos</p>
    <p class="comment">--- So if you choose to be non-judgmental ... There is a time to be judgmental and a time to be rational. The dichotomy between emotion and logic is in any case false.</p>

    <p class="comment">--- Old English, from a great list of <a href="https://ourworldenglish.com/28-untranslatable-words-from-around-the-world/" target="_blank">28 untranslatable words</a>.</p>
  <p>0044 - A truly great tool lends itself to uses you never expected. ~ Eric Raymond</p>
    <p class="comment">--- Revisiting <a href="https://www.catb.org" target="_blank">The Cathedral and the Bazaar</a>, after 25 years, it's hard to overestimate how influential it has been. The guiding principles of this essay can be applied much more widely than in the IT world. Only recently, say the past five years, have they started finding their way into the business world.<br>A broader principle applies: to be useful means to be open-ended. A great author leaves room for the reader, to the extent that his work produces secondary literature for centuries. A great politician leaves room for agreement. </p>
  <p>0045 - Whenever a theory appears to you as the only possible one, take this as a sign that you have neither understood the theory nor the problem which it was intended to solve. ~ Karl Popper</p>

    <p class="comment">--- Packing centralization, specialization, resilience, power and responsibility into a single paragraph. The Great Asimov.</p>
  <p>0048 - If we are to preserve culture we must continue to create it. ~ Johan Huizinga</p>
  <p>0049 - Inexhaustible debates: nature/nurture * causality/correlation * change/continuity * hedgehox/fox * evolution/intelligent design * atheism/religion * capitalism/socialism * culture/nature * content/form. </p>
    <p class="comment">--- None of these should be either/or. They are all about the mix.</p>
  <p id="0050">0050 - The seventh impression counts.</p>
    <p class="comment">--- By definition, the first impression is uninformed. If it were otherwise, it couldn't count as a first impression. Be careful that the seventh impression is better informed than the sixth, otherwise it cannot count as a subsequent impression either.</p>
  <p>0051 - The best that most of us can hope to achieve in physics is simply to misunderstand at a deeper level. ~ Wolfgang Pauli</p>
  <p>0052 - Equilibrium is a figment of the human imagination. ~ Kenneth Boulding (1974)</p>

  <p id="0056">0056 - There is a great deal of evidence that the fluctuations of prices in organized commodity of security markets are essentially random in nature, or at least have a very large random component. <br>K. E. Boulding, Economics as a Science, McGraw-Hill, 1970, p 121</p>
    <p class="comment">--- Hence market predictions are just fortune-telling?</p>
  <p>0057 - The law of inertia has no known origin. ~ Richard Feynman</p>
  <p>0058 - Complicating the dilemma of too few vs too many controls is the problem of uncertain "default" status.<br>Charles Perrow, Normal Accidents, Princeton University Press, 1999, p 82</p>
  <p>0059 - Tutti i fenomeni dell’universo, sieno essi prodotti della mano dell’uomo, ovvero delle universali leggi della fisica, non ci danno idea di attuale creazione, ma unicamente di una modificazione della material. <br>All the phenomena of the universe ... are not actual new creations, but merely a modification of matter.<br>Pietro Verri, “Meditazioni sulla Economia Politica” [first printed in 1773] in Custodi’s edition of the Italian Economists, Parte Moderna, t. XV., p. 22</p>  
    <p class="comment">--- A law of conservation sounds so much better in Italian, and this before the Great Laws of Conservation were articulated.</p>
  <p id="0060">0060 - I increasingly feel that to be a serious artist, you have to be a peasant - the relationships in the world conflict so much with art and despite everything, I am too weak and allow myself to more or less get carried away. ~ Anna Boch (1887)</p>
  <p>0061 - Arguments always obscure rather than clarify the truth. ~ Tolstoy</p>

    <p class="comment">--- I'm counting the days until we give up unitless quantification into all sorts of metrics or point systems.</p>
  <p>0064 - Value is not a natural property but a social construct./p>
  <p>0065 - "O homem que diz "vou" não vai, porque quando foi já não quis" Canto de Ossanha</p>
    <p class="comment">--- Chatting with my Brazilian friend, the translation of Vinicius proves a bit tricky. The phrase could mean "the man who says go and will not, when he decides to go is no longer willing" or it could as well mean "the man who says he will go, will not go because otherwise he would already be gone".</p>
  <p>0066 - Waste is worse than loss. ~ Thomas A. Edison</p>

  <p>0071 - How can long-term goals be pursued in an economy devoted to the short term? ~ Richard Sennett</p>
    <p class="comment">--- Longer-term thinking, and abandoning the tyranny of the quarterly report is a key to sustainability. But so is more holistic thinking, beyond economy towards the environment, beyond environment towards social aspects. The most credible plans think far ahead, but have concrete implementation plans for now.</p>
  <p>0072 - For wine which, when new, seemed harsh and sour becomes good wine; but that which tasted well at the vintage cannot stand age. ~ Aristo of Chios. </p>
    <p class="comment">--- Already the Romans knew that first impressions don't count.</p>
  <p>0073 - Good phrases are somewhat ambiguous, disarming, pregnant, and timeless.</p>
    <p class="comment">--- And a tiny bit of wit doesn't hurt either.</p>

  <p>0075 - Never confuse movement with action. ~ Ernest Hemingway</p>

  <p id="0080">0080 - Upon those who step into the same rivers, different and again different waters flow. - Heraclitus	</p>
  <p>0081 - Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:<br>For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.<br>Matthew 7, 7-8</p>
  <p>0082 - Market research is no substitute for thought.</p>
    <p class="comment">--- <a href="https://elevatesociety.com/quotes-by-akio-morita/" target="_blank">Akio Morita</a> comes to mind. "Carefully watch how people live, get an intuitive sense as to what they might want and then go with it. Don’t do market research."</p>
