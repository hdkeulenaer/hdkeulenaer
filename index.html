It counts napal and the cost of a nuclear warhead, and armoured cars for police who fight riots in our streets ... Yet the gross national product does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education or the joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials ... it measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile." ~ Robert Kennedy (1968);</p>
