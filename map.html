          <p style="text-indent:20px;">The Copper Map has been developed by <a href="https://www.copperalliance.org" target="_blank">Copper Alliance</a> and provides a representative sample of locations in the copper supply chain. Over 80% of production capacity for copper mining, smelting and refining is shown. As for subsequent copper processing, fabrication, foundries, wire & cable production and further downstream activities, a few typical examples are selected among many thousands of manufacturers. Overall, the Copper Map shows the complexity and ubiquity of the copper industry to make many thousands of copper products available to millions of end-users around the globe. </p>
