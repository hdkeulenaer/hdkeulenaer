          <h1>About the copper map</h1>
          <p>The Copper Map is maintained by <a href="https://www.copperalliance.org" target="_blank">Copper Alliance</a> and provides a representative sample of locations in the copper supply chain. Over 80% of production capacity for copper mining, smelting and refining is shown. As for subsequent copper processing, fabrication, foundries, wire & cable production and further downstream activities, a few typical examples are selected among many thousands of manufacturers. Overall, the Copper Map shows the complexity and ubiquity of the copper supply chain to make many thousands of copper products available to millions of end-users around the globe. </p>
          <p>The map contains the following layers:</p>
          <p><strong>Location by facility type</strong>: 300 mines, 100 smelters, 150 downstream facilities (fabricators, wire & cable producers, foundries, ...)</p>
          <p><strong>Location by member status</strong>: ICA members, Copper Alliance members, non-members</p>
          <p></p>Participants and recipients of <a href="https://coppermark.org/" target="_blank">The Copper Mark</a></p>
          <p>A separate data set provides a few dozen locations of <strong>tourist locations</strong> open for the public - mines, musea, etc</p>
          <p>-----</p>
